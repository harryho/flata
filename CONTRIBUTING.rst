1. Check for open issues or open a fresh issue to start a discussion around
   a feature idea or a bug
2. Fork `the repository <https://github.com/harryho/flatdb/>`_ on GitHub,

Philosophy of FlatDB
********************

FlatDB aims to be simple and fun to use. Therefore two key values are simplicity
and elegance of interfaces and code. These values will contradict each other
from time to time. In these cases , try using as little magic as possible.
In any case don't forget documenting code that isn't clear at first glance.

Code Conventions
****************

In general the FlatDB source should always follow `PEP 8 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_.
Exceptions are allowed in well justified and documented cases. However we make
a small exception concerning docstrings:

When using multiline docstrings, keep the opening and closing triple quotes
on their own lines and add an empty line after it.

.. code-block:: python

    def some_function():
        """
        Documentation ...
        """

        # implementation ...

Version Numbers
***************

FlatDB follows the `SemVer versioning guidelines <http://semver.org/>`_.
This implies that backwards incompatible changes in the API will increment
the major version. So think twice before making such changes.
